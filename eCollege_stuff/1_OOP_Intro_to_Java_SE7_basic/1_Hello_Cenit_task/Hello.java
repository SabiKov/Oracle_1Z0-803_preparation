	This is a basic Java program which part of the course.
	The description is the following steps: 
	1.1 Hello Cenit
		1. Using Notepad++ or another plain code editor, 
			create a Java program called Hello to display the text 'Hello Cenit'.
		2. Add comments that clearly show what each line of the program does
			(except the braces). Include any unique features of the main method
			and the purpose of the modifiers to the class and main method.
		3. Compile and run your program to ensure that it works.
		4. Ensure that it conforms to the requirements of well written java source code.
			(Neat and readable appearance, indented properly etc.) 
			As it should be written in a plain code editor(i.e. Notepad or Notepad++),
			it should not have any IDE generated references to a package or system generated 
			comments that do not apply to this program.
		5. Save it as Hello.java
